### Project Tasks:

* Create an index.html file with a form that includes 2 text input fields, a "calculate" button, and an area to display output.
* Create a main.js file and link it to your index.html file
* Using the DOM API and the elements on the page, set up the following:
  * When I click the "calculate" button, the value in the first box should be added to the value in the second box.
  * Your output should be injected into the area for displaying output.
* Add some styles to this project and make it something pretty to look at.

## Initial Review of project
* Scale of 1-10 (1 = easy, 10 = impossible)
* 8

* Began with very little understanding of Javascript. Struggled with the language, but was able to tool around, experiment, and with my instructors processing of the problem, I was able to come to a solution.
